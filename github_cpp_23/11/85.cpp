/*
	This file provides a generic STL-based implementation
	of the heapsort algorithm.
	
	Heapsort is comparable in speed to quicksort, but is
	stable and features a better worstcase complexity.
	Like all efficient sorting algorithms, it relies on a
	random accessible datastructure like std::vector.
	As the STL already provides the necessary functionality
	with the algorithms header, the "implementation" is trivial.

	Complexity:
		O( N*log(N) ) comparisions
		O( 1 ) auxiliary space
