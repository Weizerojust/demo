/*
	This file provides a generic STL-based implementation
	of the selection sort algorithm.

	Selection sort is probably the most simple comparision-based
	sorting algorithm. Beeing even slower than the otherwise
	comparable insertion sort algorithm, it is of mostly academic use.

	Complexity:
		O( N^2 ) comparisions
		O( 1 ) auxiliary space
